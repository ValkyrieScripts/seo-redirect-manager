                        SEO REDIRECT MANAGER
                        Project Description
================================================================================

OVERVIEW
--------
A tool for managing 301 redirects from expired/purchased domains to capture
their SEO backlink value. When you acquire an expired domain that has existing
backlinks pointing to it, this tool redirects all traffic to your target site,
passing along the "link juice" for SEO benefits.

SEO tools (Ahrefs, Moz, SEMrush) are automatically blocked so they can't detect
the redirects, while search engines (Google, Bing) receive the 301 redirect.


HOW IT WORKS
------------
1. You purchase an expired domain that has valuable backlinks
2. Add the domain to this system with a target URL
3. Point the domain's DNS to this server (via Cloudflare)
4. All traffic to the expired domain gets 301 redirected to your target
5. Search engines follow the redirect and pass link authority to your site
6. SEO tools see 404 (domain appears dead to them)


FEATURES
--------
- Full Domain Redirect: All paths redirect to target URL
- Path-Specific Redirect: Only backlink paths redirect (more control)
- SEO Tool Blocking: Returns 404 to Ahrefs, Moz, SEMrush, etc.
- Backlink Import: Paste CSV format during domain creation or later
- Auto-extract paths: Full URLs in CSV are automatically parsed
- Redirect Status Check: Test if redirects are working correctly
- Cloudflare Integration: Masks origin IP from detection (recommended)
- Dark theme dashboard with setup instructions


TYPICAL WORKFLOW
----------------
1. Login to dashboard
   URL: https://skuldpath.com
   Default: admin / 1509

2. Click "Add Domain"
   - Enter the expired domain name (e.g., old-expired-site.com)
   - Enter your target URL (e.g., https://mysite.com)
   - Choose redirect mode:
     * Full Domain: All paths redirect
     * Path-Specific: Only imported backlink paths redirect
   - If Path-Specific: Paste your backlinks (CSV format) right away
   - Click Add

3. Configure Cloudflare DNS
   - Add domain to Cloudflare (if not already)
   - Add A record: @ -> 89.147.108.50 (Proxied - orange cloud)
   - Add A record: www -> 89.147.108.50 (Proxied - orange cloud)
   - Set SSL/TLS mode to "Flexible" (IMPORTANT!)

4. Import backlinks (optional, for path-specific mode)
   - Get backlink data from Ahrefs, Moz, or similar tool
   - Format as CSV: full_linking_url,path_on_expired_domain
   - Example:
     https://blog.example.com/post-about-topic,/old-article
     https://news-site.org/article,/best-guide
     https://forum.net/thread/123,/
   - Paste via the domain detail page

5. Activate the domain
   - Toggle status to "Active"
   - Nginx config is auto-generated

6. Test redirects
   - Click "Check" on dashboard or "Test Redirects" on domain detail page
   - Verify all paths return 301 to correct target URL
   - Green = working, Yellow = warning, Red = error

7. Send linking URLs to indexer
   - Copy linking URLs from domain detail page
   - Submit to Google Search Console or indexing service
   - This triggers Google to re-crawl and discover the redirect


FILE FORMAT FOR BACKLINK IMPORT
-------------------------------
CSV format with two columns:
  linking_url,path

Examples:
  https://blog.example.com/some-post,/old-page
  https://news-site.org/article-title,/another-page
  https://forum.net/thread,/

You can also paste full URLs - paths are auto-extracted:
  https://blog.example.com/post,https://expired-domain.com/old-page
  (automatically extracts /old-page as the path)

- linking_url: Full URL of page containing backlink (for indexing)
- path: Path on expired domain (or full URL - will be parsed)


REDIRECT MODES
--------------
Full Domain:
  - All paths (/*) redirect to target URL
  - Simple, catches everything
  - Best when you don't need granular control

Path-Specific:
  - Only paths with imported backlinks redirect
  - Unmatched paths: choose 404 or redirect to target
  - More control over what gets redirected
  - Useful when you want specific paths only

DEPLOYMENT
----------
The application runs via Docker Compose with three containers:
  - seo-redirect-backend: Node.js API server
  - seo-redirect-frontend: nginx serving React app
  - seo-redirector: OpenResty handling actual redirects

To deploy updates:
  cd /opt/seo-redirect-manager
  git pull
  docker compose up -d --build


CLOUDFLARE SETUP (IMPORTANT)
----------------------------
For each redirect domain:

1. DNS Records:
   Type: A | Name: @ | Content: 89.147.108.50 | Proxy: ON (orange)
   Type: A | Name: www | Content: 89.147.108.50 | Proxy: ON (orange)

2. SSL/TLS Settings:
   Mode: Flexible (NOT Full!)

   Why Flexible? Our server only serves HTTP on port 80.
   Cloudflare handles HTTPS for visitors.

WHY USE CLOUDFLARE?
-------------------
Using Cloudflare proxy is recommended because:

1. Hides origin IP pattern - Without Cloudflare, Google sees all your
   expired domains resolving to the same IP (89.147.108.50). This pattern
   could trigger detection and devalue the links.

2. Free HTTPS - Backlinks may use https:// URLs. Cloudflare provides
   SSL certificates automatically.

3. Masks infrastructure - SEO tools only see Cloudflare, not your server.

If you point directly to VPS without Cloudflare:
- All domains resolve to same IP (easier to detect as redirect farm)
- You'd need to set up SSL certificates manually for each domain
